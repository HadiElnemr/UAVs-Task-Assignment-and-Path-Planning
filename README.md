## Optimisation Techniques for Multi-UAV Task Assignment and Path Planning Problem

In this project, we study multiple optimisation techniques to tackle the task assignment and path planning problem for multi Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

This problem, abbreviated as MUTAPP problem, is considered an NP-hard problem and can be described as a Multi Travelling Salesman Problem (MTSP).

We encounter solutions such as Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Hybrid Ant Colony Optimisation and Whale Optimisation Algorithm (H-ACO-WOA), and Hybrid ACO and Dragonfly Algorithm (H-ACO-DA).
